- Hullo, I'm @Sanpele. Im a recent grad who is lost and confused without the structure and rewards of School and Schoolwork. I am looking to fill this void in my life with full time employment. 

- I'm interested in developing software, programming and the science of computers. Specifically, i enjoy coding, solving problems and the rewards of the scientific method. 

- I am current learning how to code OO php before i get too frustrated with html/css and try and learn react. Also i am starting work on a OCR assisted android app answering some of lifes least important questions. Finally, I am intersted in learning how to setup a personal web-server with a rapi.
